Due to the Canucks' home game and 'Looking Back on 2025' event, we're anticipating increased foot traffic. To prepare, please make sure to have an adequate stock of pre-rolls and beverages readily available for quick purchases. With a potential increase in sales, consider staffing at Normal+ levels if possible.\n\nLet's review our inventory counts before opening to ensure we're adequately prepared for the expected surge in demand. Let's work together to provide excellent service and make today a successful one!\""
